# What is this?
This is a small game for a conlang I made called Mouthful. Also included is a small
game egine of sorts for making text adventure games that utilize Mouthful as the
input language from the user.

# Like.. why?
I thought being able to make games that use a conlang I made as it's input language,
it would be a more fun resource for learning the language rather than _just_ reading
and writing the language. This way, you can read and write it and see how it affects
the world around you.
